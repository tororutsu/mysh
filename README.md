A simple script to make/view notes and a todo list using [gum by charm](https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum)

I made this simple program to test my bash skills and to start understanding to work of maintaining an OSS project.
Everything about this project is my first, including the `Makefile` so any feedback is more than welcome!

## Install

You will need [gum](https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum) for this script to work!

1. Clone Repository
  - `git clone https://github.com/tororutsu/mysh.git`
2. Run Make
  - `make install`
3. Program installs to `~/.local` so no need for `sudo`

## Usage

This program is very much under maintenance. There is not much usage as of yet.
I plan on updating README everytime something changes.

**UPDATE**

- Notes: You are now able to add notes in the note menu!

- Notes/Edit: You are now able to edit notes in the note menu!
